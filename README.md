# Dotfiles

Minimal, boring, modern dotfiles.

## Philosophy

- Prefer defaults over cleverness
- One tool at a time
- No plugin unless it earns its keep
- Vim muscle memory everywhere
- Easy to delete, easy to rebuild

## What’s included

- Zsh with vi-style command line editing
- Neovim with relative line numbers
- Optional tools layered incrementally (zoxide, fzf, etc.)

## What’s intentionally missing

- Oh My Zsh
- Heavy plugin frameworks
- Auto-installing half the internet
- Anything I don’t use weekly

## Bootstrap

```sh
git clone <this repo> ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
